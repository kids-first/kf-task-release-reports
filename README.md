# Kids First Release Report Task Service

The Release Report task service runs as part of a release to summarize the
release being made into a tidy report.


## Design

The Release Report Service follows the [Task Service spec](https://kids-first.github.io/kf-api-release-coordinator/docs/task.html)
outlined by the Release Coordinator.
